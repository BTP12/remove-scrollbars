# remove-scrollbars
A stupid, simple extension that hides all scrollbars in Chrome with one line of CSS.
I created this mainly so that I could make my first web extension, and also since I think scrollbars are ugly most the time.

# Installation
Download the repository, enable Developer Mode in *chrome://extensions*, click "Load Unpacked" and then select the "extensions" file.
I'll see if I can upload this to the Chrome Web Store soon.
